Symmetric Cryptography Versus Asymmetric Cryptography 
SymmetricVkey cryptography is based on sharing secrecy; asymmetricVkey cryptography is based on personal secrecy. NoteV1
10.7In symmetricVkey cryptography system, the number of keys needed for each user is 1.In asymmetricVkey cryptography system, the number of keys needed for each user is 2.NoteV2
Symmetric Cryptography Versus Asymmetric Cryptography 
In symmetricVkey cryptography, symbols in plaintext and ciphertext are permuted or substituted. 
In asymmetric Vkey cryptography,  plaintext and ciphertext 
NoteV3
10.8SymmetricVkey cryptography is appropriate for long messages, and the speed of encryption/decryption is fast. AsymmetricVkey cryptography is appropriate for short messages, and the speed of encryption/decryption is slow. NoteV4In asymmetric Vkey cryptography,  plaintext and ciphertext 
are treated as integers. 
The main idea behind asymmetric8key cryptography is the 
concept of the trapdoor one8way function. 10.1.4 Trapdoor OneVWay Function

it is always easy to calculate n; given n, it is very difficult to

When nis large, the function y= xmod nis a trapdoor one8way 
function. Given x, k, and n, it is easy to calculate y. Given y, k,

When Alice wants Bob to send her a message, she: 
/boxshadowdwnSelects two (large) primes p, q, TOP SECRET ,
/boxshadowdwnComputes n= pqand φ(n) = ( pv1)( qv1).  φ(n) is TOP SECRET .
/boxshadowdwnSelects an integer e, 1 < e < φ(n), such that gcd( e, φ(n)) = 1, 
/boxshadowdwnComputes d, such that d*e (mod φ(n))= 1,  dalso TOP SECRET ,

10.2.3  Some Trivial Examples 
Example 10. 5
Bob chooses 7 and 11 as pand qand calculates n= 77. The value of 
φ(n) = (7 − 1)(11 − 1) or 60. Now he chooses two exponents, eand d,
from Z60 ∗. If he chooses eto be 13, then d is 37. Note that e×dmod 
60 = 1 (they are inverses of each Now imagine that Alice wants to send the plaintext 5 to Bob. She uses the public exponent 13 to encrypt 5.

Bob receives the ciphertext 26 and uses the private key 37 to decipher the ciphertext:

Now assume that another person, John, wants to send a message to 
Bob. John can use the same public key announced by Bob (probably on his website), 13; John’s plaintext is 63. John calculates the following:

Bob receives the ciphertext 28 and uses his private key 37 to decipher the ciphertext: 
10.2.3  Some Trivial Examples 
Example 10. 7
Jennifer creates a pair of keys for herself. She chooses p= 397 and q
= 401. She calculates n= 159197. She then calculates φ(n) = 158400. 
She then chooses e = 343 and d = 12007. Show how Ted can send a message to Jennifer if he knows eand n.
10.22 Suppose Ted wants to send the message “NO” to Jennifer. He changes each character to a number (from 00 to 25), with each character coded as two digits. He then concatenates the two coded characters and gets a fourvdigit number. The plaintext is 1314. Figure 10.7 shows the process.

10.2.4  Continued 
Factorization Attack 
/boxshadowdwnThe security of RSA is based on the idea that the modulus is so large that is infeasible to factor it in reasonable time. 
/boxshadowdwnEven though n is public, p & q are secret. If Eve can factor n 
10.25 /boxshadowdwnEven though n is public, p & q are secret. If Eve can factor n 
and get p & q, she can calculate Φ(n). Then she can calculate d=e mod Φ(n) because e is public. 
Recommendations 
/boxshadowdwnThe number of bits in n should be at least 1024.
/boxshadowdwnTwo primes p & q must be 512 bit at least. 
/boxshadowdwnp & q should not be close to each other. 
/boxshadowdwnModulus n must not be shared. 
10.26 /boxshadowdwnModulus n must not be shared. 
/boxshadowdwnIf d is leaked, immediately change n, e and d. 
/boxshadowdwnMessage must be padded by OAEP.
